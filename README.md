# SpiralGenerator
Displays dots with an increasing distance from the center. The "spiral factor" represents 1/n where n is the number of dots per circle. For example, if .25 is the spiral factor, there would be 4 dots per revolution. This would draw a cross shape.
### Sizes
The x and y size are the sizes of the dots in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively.
### Zoom
The zoom factor is a way of visually zooming into the middle of the picture. The higher the value, the more the picture will zoom into the middle.
### Speed
The speed field represents the speed of the animation after toggling the movie. The higher the value, the longer time there will be between frames of the movie. Therefore, the larger the number, the slower it will be.
### Crazy
The crazy factor arose out of serendipity when I changed the wrong variable while creating the program. It just makes the spiral look cool.
### Color Mode
I was just bored when I added this.
